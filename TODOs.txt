This file is to keep track of all the features and fixed that need to be implemented before the paper is published:

 - Finish improving robustness of codegen by adding code to detect possible GLSL errors before they occur and give the user a more useful error
 - Implement dynamic local size through specialization constants
 - Add proper memory cleanup
